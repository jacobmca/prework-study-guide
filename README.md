## Description

This is a bootcamp prework project, designed to intro me to the basic concepts of the bootcamp I'm taking as well as coding at large. This project not only fulfills the requirements of the bootcamp's prework assignment, but demonstrates my already standing knowledge of basic markup and front end coding. I also learned some details about Git, Github, and deployment by building this project.
